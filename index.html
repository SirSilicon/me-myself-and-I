      <h3>discription</h3>
        <p class="table">Armed with a powerful intellect
        and vivid a imagination, I can overcome
        or outmaneuver obstacles that seem
        unbeatable to most. At the same time,
        my many quirks, such as often
        unconstrained rationalism, lead to many
        misunderstandings. My brain loves patterns,
        and spotting discrepancies between statements
        could almost be described as a hobby,
        making it a bad idea to lie to me. This
        makes it ironic that my word should
        always be taken with a grain of salt
        – it’s not that I am dishonest, but
        I tend to share thoughts that are not
        fully developed, using others as a
        sounding board for ideas and theories
        in a debate against myself rather than
        as actual conversation partners.</p>
